# Builtin Plugins

AgentGuard includes built-in plugins for common runtime protection needs. This page groups the built-in plugins currently documented in this manual by where they run.

## Built-in Client Plugins

- [jailbreak_check](jailbreak_check.md): an `llm_before` prompt-injection detector that can run locally inside the agent process and block suspicious prompts before they reach the model.

## Built-in Server Plugins

- [rule_based_plugin](rule_based_plugin.md): a server-only rule engine for tool-call access control and policy evaluation that can either return fixed `ALLOW` / `DENY` decisions or escalate matched cases to `HUMAN_CHECK` / `LLM_CHECK`.
- [jailbreak_check](jailbreak_check.md): the same LLM-input detector can also run on the AgentGuard server when you want centralized governance and auditing.
- [Thought-Aligner](thought_aligner.md): an opt-in `llm_after` intervention that rewrites exposed reasoning on the server and makes a compatible Python client regenerate its action before execution.

Other utility plugins also exist in the codebase, but this page focuses on the built-in plugins that are documented for direct use in the public docs.
