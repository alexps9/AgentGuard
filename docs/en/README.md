# Quick Deployment

## Prerequisites
* Python >= 3.11
* pip
* Docker (if using Docker deployment)

## Setup

### Step 1: Prepare an agent

To apply access control to a target agent, you need its source code. Here we use LangChain as an example and build a minimal zero-shot ReAct agent.

#### 1. Install LangChain

```bash
pip install langchain==1.2.18
pip install langchain-openai==1.2.1
```

> This guide uses LangChain 1.2.18. AgentGuard currently supports LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, OpenAI Agents SDK, and OpenClaw; here we use LangChain only as the quickest walkthrough example.

#### 2. Write the agent code

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.tools import tool

LLM_API_KEY = "<YOUR KEY>"         # Fill this manually
LLM_MODEL_NAME = "gpt-5.4-mini"

@tool
def retrieve_doc(id: int) -> str:
    """Retrieve a document by integer id."""
    return f"DOC#{id}: This is a mocked document body."

@tool
def send_email_to(doc: str, addr: str) -> str:
    """Send a document to an email address."""
    return f"Email has sent to {addr}: {doc}"

def build_llm():
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

    return ChatOpenAI(
        api_key=LLM_API_KEY,
        model=LLM_MODEL_NAME,
        temperature=0,
    )

def build_agent():
    return create_agent(
        model=build_llm(),
        tools=[retrieve_doc, send_email_to],
        system_prompt=(
            "You are a zero-shot ReAct style agent. Decide which tool to use, "
            "observe tool results, and continue until the user's task is complete."
        ),
    )

def run(agent, prompt):
    print("===================================")
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt}")
    result = agent.invoke(
        {
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": prompt,
                }
            ]
        }
    )
    print(f"Output: {result['messages'][-1].content}")
    print("===================================\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = build_agent()

    run(agent, "Please retrieve document id=0 and send it to admin@example.com.")
    run(agent, "Please retrieve document id=0 and send it to alice@example.com.")
```

### Step 2: AgentGuard Client Importing

On top of the agent code from Step 1, you next need to import the AgentGuard client SDK. The client communicates with the control server, forwards the agent's runtime state, and receives access-control decisions.

#### 1. Install the AgentGuard client SDK

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anonymous/AgentGuard.git
cd AgentGuard
pip install -e .
```

#### 2. Import the client

Below is the complete code after importing the AgentGuard client. Lines marked with 🚩 show where the client is inserted:

If you want a framework-agnostic explanation first, see [AgentGuard Client](how-to-plugin/agentguard_client.md). If you are integrating a different runtime, see the dedicated pages for [LangGraph](how-to-plugin/langgraph.md), [LlamaIndex](how-to-plugin/llamaindex.md), [AutoGen](how-to-plugin/autogen.md), [OpenAI Agents SDK](how-to-plugin/openai_agents_sdk.md), and [OpenClaw](how-to-plugin/openclaw_adapter.md).

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.tools import tool

# 🚩 Import the AgentGuard client SDK
from agentguard import Guard, Principal

LLM_API_KEY = "<YOUR KEY>"         # Fill this manually
LLM_MODEL_NAME = "gpt-5.4-mini"

@tool
def retrieve_doc(id: int) -> str:
    """Retrieve a document by integer id."""
    return f"DOC#{id}: This is a mocked document body."

@tool
def send_email_to(doc: str, addr: str) -> str:
    """Send a document to an email address."""
    return f"Email has sent to {addr}: {doc}"

def build_llm():
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

    return ChatOpenAI(
        api_key=LLM_API_KEY,
        model=LLM_MODEL_NAME,
        temperature=0,
    )

def build_agent():
    return create_agent(
        model=build_llm(),
        tools=[retrieve_doc, send_email_to],
        system_prompt=(
            "You are a zero-shot ReAct style agent. Decide which tool to use, "
            "observe tool results, and continue until the user's task is complete."
        ),
    )

def run(agent, prompt):
    print("===================================")
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt}")
    result = agent.invoke(
        {
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": prompt,
                }
            ]
        }
    )
    print(f"Output: {result['messages'][-1].content}")
    print("===================================\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = build_agent()

    # 🚩 Load the guard client
    guard = Guard(
        remote_url="http://<Control Server IP>:38080",      # Replace with your control server IP and port
        mode="enforce",
        fail_open=False,
    )

    # 🚩 Create a principal for the agent
    principal = Principal(
        agent_id="langchain-remote-demo",
        session_id="langchain-remote-session",
        role="default",
        trust_level=1,
    )

    # 🚩 Start a session with the principal
    guard.start(principal=principal, goal="langchain remote runnable host demo")

    # 🚩 Attach the guard to the LangChain agent
    guard.attach_langchain(agent)

    try:
        run(agent, "Please retrieve document id=0 and send it to admin@example.com.")
        run(agent, "Please retrieve document id=0 and send it to alice@example.com.")
    finally:
        # 🚩 Close the guard
        guard.close()
```

* `Guard()`: configures the control server address. This must match the server's configuration — see the control-server deployment section below.
* `Principal()`: defines the agent's identity, including agent ID, session ID, role, and trust level. These attributes are used to build constraints in access control policies.
* `guard.start()`: opens an access-control session, linking the agent's identity and task goal, and starts communicating with the control server. Call this before the agent begins its task.
* `guard.attach_langchain()`: attaches the client to a LangChain agent instance. For other built-in adapters, use `guard.attach_langgraph()`, `guard.attach_llamaindex()`, `guard.attach_autogen()`, or `guard.attach_openai_agents()` as appropriate.
* `guard.close()`: closes the session and releases resources. Call this after the agent has finished all tasks.

### Step 3: AgentGuard Plugins and Custom Auditors

See the standalone extension chapters:

- [AgentGuard Plugins](plugins.md)
- [Custom Auditors](auditors.md)

### Step 4: Write a policy and deploy the control server

AgentGuard uses a client-server architecture. All management operations — agent monitoring, policy configuration, policy enforcement, and decision dispatch — happen on the control server. This is especially useful when an organization has multiple agent deployments that need centralized governance.

Although the control server and agents can run on the same host, we recommend deploying the server on a dedicated machine for better scalability. The instructions below assume you've chosen a separate host for the server.

First, clone the project on the control server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anonymous/AgentGuard.git
cd AgentGuard
```

#### 1. Write a plugin config file

Before writing any access-control policy, first define which server-side plugin is active in this quick start:

```bash
mkdir -p config

cat <<EOF > config/plugins.json
{
  "phases": {
    "llm_before": {
      "client": [],
      "server": []
    },
    "llm_after": {
      "client": [],
      "server": []
    },
    "tool_before": {
      "client": [],
      "server": [
        {
          "name": "rule_based_plugin",
          "env": {}
        }
      ]
    },
    "tool_after": {
      "client": [],
      "server": []
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

This config means: only the `tool_before` phase runs a server plugin, and that plugin is the built-in `rule_based_plugin`. All other phases are empty. In other words, the server will evaluate your policy rules only right before a tool call runs. `rule_based_plugin` can either return fixed `ALLOW` / `DENY` decisions directly or escalate a matched case to human or LLM review; in this quick start, we keep the flow focused on direct access-control decisions around tool execution, without introducing additional LLM-phase or tool-result plugins yet.

#### 2. Create an access control policy

Our agent has two tools: `retrieve_doc` and `send_email_to` — one retrieves a document by ID, the other sends it to an email address. Suppose we want agents with trust level below 2 to only send the confidential document (id 0) to `admin@example.com`, and block all other recipients. We can create a policy file:

```bash
mkdir -p rules

cat <<EOF > rules/block_email_send.rules
RULE: block_untrusted_email_send
TRACE: Retriever -> ...? -> Mailer
CONDITION: Retriever.name == "retrieve_doc"
           AND Mailer.name == "send_email_to"
           AND Retriever.id == 0
           AND Mailer.addr != "admin@example.com"
           AND principal.trust_level < 2
POLICY: DENY
Severity: high
Category: data_exfiltration
Reason: "Low-trust principal cannot send document 0 to non-admin recipients"
EOF
```

AgentGuard provides a dedicated DSL for writing policies consumed by the built-in `rule_based_plugin` plugin, which we'll cover in detail in [Policy DSL Structure](./policies/dsl_basic_structure.md).

#### 3. Deploy the AgentGuard control server

We offer two deployment methods: Docker and source code.

##### Docker deployment (recommended)

> You need Docker installed first.

Docker deployment is straightforward. First set the plugin config path in `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then set:
# AGENTGUARD_SERVER_PLUGIN_CONFIG=./config/plugins.json
```

Then run this command from the project root:

```bash
./scripts/start.sh -d
```

The control server listens on port `38080` by default.

We also provide a web UI that lets you monitor agent runtime status, audit policy enforcement records, and configure policies interactively. For new users, we recommend using the UI to manage access control. Visit `http://localhost:38008` in your browser to access it.

Below is a screenshot of the interactive policy configuration UI:

![UI policy configuration](../figs/ui_configure_policy.png)

We'll cover interactive `rule_based_plugin` policy configuration in detail in [Visual Policy Configuration](./policies/quick_config.md).

##### Source-code deployment

If you prefer source-code deployment, install the dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install -e ".[server]"
```

Then start the control server:

```bash
AGENTGUARD_SERVER_PLUGIN_CONFIG=./config/plugins.json \
python -m agentguard serve \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 38080 \
    --policy rules/block_email_send.rules
```

* `--port`: the port the control server listens on.
* `--policy`: path to a policy file. You can pass multiple files with `--policy fileA --policy fileB ...`.

You can also start the UI:

```bash
./scripts/run-frontend.sh
```

Visit `http://localhost:8008` to access the UI.

### Step 5: Run the agent

On the agent host, run the agent code:

```bash
python <LANGCHAIN_AGENT_FILE>
```

Expected behavior: the first task succeeds — the confidential document is sent to `admin@example.com`. The second task fails — when the agent tries to send the same document to `alice@example.com`, an exception is raised and the call is denied.

Expected output:

```
===================================
Prompt: Please retrieve document id=0 and send it to admin@example.com.
Output: Done — document 0 was retrieved and sent to admin@example.com.
===================================

===================================
Prompt: Please retrieve document id=0 and send it to alice@example.com.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...", line 83, in <module>
    run(agent, "Please retrieve document id=0 and send it to alice@example.com.")
  ...
    raise DecisionDenied(
agentguard.models.errors.DecisionDenied: block_untrusted_email_send
During task with name 'tools' and id 'ab34afab-e0f3-14f6-7517-bba2e47f0ea6'
```
